"""
Deterministic orchestration helpers for Ripper Collector.

The active commands map submitted documents/repositories, build project-only
profiles, validate enrichment, deposit archives, and list archives. This module
also retains the former job-application helpers for compatibility with old
fixtures and explicit maintenance; those helpers are marked ``legacy`` in the
CLI and are not called by the active Collector Skill.

These are CLI-callable so SKILL.md can shell out without re-implementing logic
in a prompt, and importable so tests can exercise every branch.

#
# Background: weaker models (observed on Haiku 4.5 in issue #29, NOT on Opus
# 4.7) sometimes ignore the interview-coach prompt's "do not write to disk"
# constraint and use the Write tool to create a markdown file with a

# the suspenders. Even if a future model regresses against the prompt, the
# scan removes the rogue file before the student sees it.

# Anti-footgun rules:
#   - Top-level only (never recursive). Students may have legitimate
#     interview-prep notes in subdirectories.
#   - mtime gate: only files newer than the dispatch timestamp are

#   - Name match: the file's basename must contain "interview", "prep", or
#     "bundle" (case-insensitive substring). These are the shapes the issue

# 2.6 cleanup_stray_prompts: defense-in-depth for prompt-staging PII leaks
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Background: real-run testing of #43 surfaced that some agents (Claude Code's
# Bash tool was the observed offender on macOS) improvise around SKILL.md's
# prompt-build pattern. Instead of capturing the rendered prompt in a shell
# variable (which can hit argv-length caps for the folder-miner prompt at
# 100KB+), they write it to `/tmp/<kind>-prompt.txt` and pass the path. That
# leaks the student's resume + JD + project content as plaintext PII into a
# directory that's world-readable on macOS (mode 0755) until reboot.
#
# Belt-and-suspenders fix:
#   - Suspenders: SKILL.md now prescribes `$RUN_DIR/prompts/<kind>.txt`
#     for prompt staging (gitignored, run-scoped, wiped each run).
#   - Belt: this scan runs at end of Phase 8 to catch and delete any
#     /tmp/<kind>-prompt.{txt,md} file the agent improvised anyway.
#
# Anti-footgun rules:
#   - Top-level only (never recursive). /tmp has many other tools' files;
#     we only look at the immediate top.
#   - mtime gate: only files newer than the run's start timestamp are
#     candidates. Pre-existing /tmp files (other tools' debug output) are
#     never touched.
#   - Name match: basename must equal `<kind>-prompt.<ext>` or
#     `<kind>_prompt.<ext>` for a kind in PROMPT_KINDS, with .txt / .md
#     suffix. Generic /tmp files like `bash_history` or `screenshot.png`
#     are never touched.
#   - Action: delete unconditionally. These are transient sub-agent
#     intermediates; there's no recovery value, and they contain PII we
#     want gone. (If you ever decide you want them moved-and-logged for
#     debugging, file a new issue and we can flip the action.)

# Observed under qwen3.6-35b on OpenCode (run ses_236d) — the model
# produced `**ROLE:** Data Analyst` instead of `ROLE: Data Analyst`,
# leaving role.txt empty and forcing the orchestrator to fabricate
# downstream telemetry values.

# The trick is `[\s*]*` (character class of whitespace OR `*`) before
# and after each meaningful token: it absorbs any mix of `*` markers
# and spaces in any order, regardless of which side of the colon the
# bold delimiters sit on. Earlier attempts with separate `\*{0,2}`

# inspect — JSON introspection for agent-driven debugging.
#
# When a student says "my resume looks wrong," the AI CLI running the
# ripper-collector skill follows the playbook in SKILL.md's "Debugging this skill"
# section. That playbook calls these `inspect` helpers to get structured
# views of the artifacts: the parsed resume tree, the extracted PDF text,
# the source photo dimensions. Each helper returns JSON so the LLM can read
# it without having to shell-parse the output.
#
# Design: these return DATA, not interpretations. The LLM does the
# hypothesis-forming using docs/KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md as a checklist.
# We include a light `warnings` field that surfaces three obvious
# parser-state red flags (empty name, empty contact, orphaned bullets);
# the failure modes doc covers everything else.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    markdown "looks like" and what the parser actually extracted. If the
