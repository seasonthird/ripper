-- Address Supabase security linter findings:
--
--   ERROR: views had SECURITY DEFINER (Postgres default) — recreate with
--          security_invoker=true so views respect the caller's RLS.
--   WARN:  run_telemetry_retention had mutable search_path — pin it.
--
-- Views still REVOKE SELECT FROM anon, so only service_role can query them.
-- security_invoker adds a second layer: even if someone grants a view to
-- anon by mistake, the caller's RLS on the underlying tables blocks the read.
