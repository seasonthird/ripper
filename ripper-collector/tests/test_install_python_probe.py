"""
Regression test for install.sh's Python interpreter discovery.

On Windows, the Microsoft Store ships an "App Execution Alias" for `python3`
at C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\python3. It is a
real file on PATH, so `command -v python3` reports success — but executing
it prints "Python was not found..." to stderr and exits non-zero. That
behavior bit a cohort student (@b0glarka) during verification of #33: her
real Python was at /c/Python314/python, but install.sh trusted the MS Store
stub at /c/Users/boga/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/python3 and
aborted at `python3 -m venv` without ever falling through to the working
`python` fallback.

Windows CI (actions/setup-python@v6) cannot reproduce this: it installs
python3 at a clean hostedtoolcache path with no MS Store shim in sight. So
we simulate the stub here — a fake python3 shim on PATH that mimics the
MS Store failure mode — and assert that install.sh actually probes each
candidate (by invoking it) rather than trusting `command -v` alone.
