"""Tier 3: live LLM regression test for issue #29.

Invokes `claude -p` against Haiku 4.5 with the real interview-coach prompt
and asserts:
  1. Haiku does NOT call the Write tool during its response.
  2. Haiku does NOT plant any stray markdown file in the simulated student
     working directory.

## Why this test is venv-independent

`scripts.prompts.build_prompt()` is pure-stdlib (only `dataclasses` and
`typing`). Calling it in-process avoids subprocessing into the project's
`.venv`, which would otherwise tie this test to the host platform that
created the venv. The only subprocess we need is `claude -p` itself.

This decoupling means the test runs on whatever Python pytest itself is
using — your host's system Python, conda env, sandbox venv, all fine. As
long as `pytest` and the `claude` CLI are reachable, the test runs.

## Auto-skip conditions

  - `claude` CLI not on PATH (CI runners, fresh clones — typical case)
  - `RIPPER_COLLECTOR_SKIP_LIVE=1` (manual escape hatch when you don't want to
    burn token budget on a noisy iteration loop)

Cost: one Haiku response per test. On any paid Claude plan that's
effectively zero per run. On pay-as-you-go: a couple of cents.

## Companion tests

  - `tests/test_cleanup_stray_outputs.py` — proves the BELT (the post-Phase-6
    cleanup scan) catches rogue files even if Haiku misbehaves.
  - `tests/test_interview_coach_prompt.py` — structural assertions on the
    prompt text that gate against future regressions of the framing.

This live test is the one that actually proves the SUSPENDERS — the prompt
surgery itself stops Haiku from calling Write in the first place.
