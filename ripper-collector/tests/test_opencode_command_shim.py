"""OpenCode slash-command shim assertions.

OpenCode resolves `/ripper-collector <args>` by reading
`~/.config/opencode/commands/ripper-collector.md` and substituting `$ARGUMENTS`
into its body. Without the shim, OpenCode falls back to pasting the full
SKILL.md as a user message and silently drops the argument — observed
under qwen3.6-35b in run ses_235c, where the model replied "I've loaded
the ripper-collector skill. What would you like me to do?" instead of
executing.

These tests pin (a) the shim file exists at the canonical repo location,
(b) it has correct YAML frontmatter, (c) the body invokes the skill and
references `$ARGUMENTS`, and (d) install.sh installs it when OpenCode is
detected. Future edits that drop any of these break the slash-command
wiring on OpenCode and a regression appears as "loading the skill but
not running it" — silent degradation that's hard to spot in a transcript.
