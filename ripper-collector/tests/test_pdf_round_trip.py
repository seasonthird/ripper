"""
End-to-end PDF round-trip against the GOLDEN_FIXTURES/ realistic resume.

The existing tests in test_render_pdf.py cover parser correctness and
rendering invariants on small inline samples. This file covers the
realistic shape: the full Ana Müller fixture students actually read when
they first open the repo, run through render_resume_eu and render_resume_us,
then extracted with pdfminer.six and asserted against the claims the README
makes ("ATS-safe", "<200KB", "sections parse the way you'd expect").

A regression here means the tool is shipping broken output to students.
That's the line CI defends.

Artifacts are written to /tmp/ripper-collector-ci-pdfs/ so CI can upload them on
failure for a human to open and eyeball.
