Tests for scripts/render_pdf.py.

Strategy: produce PDFs from known markdown inputs, then extract text with
pdfminer.six and assert every expected substring made it through. That's the
automated tier of the ATS verification gate from the design doc.

Also covers:
- EU vs US section ordering
- US style always suppresses photo (invariant enforced in render_resume_us)
- Unicode content (Björn, Jiří Švec, François, emoji) round-trips
- Empty sections don't break layout
- HTML-ish special chars (&, <, >) are escaped, not interpreted
- Cover letter + interview prep renders produce readable PDFs

**Re:** Data Analyst

Dear Deloitte Hiring Team,

I'm writing to apply for the Data Analyst role at Deloitte. My MSc capstone on inventory optimization for FirmX gives me direct experience with the kind of consulting engagement your Vienna practice runs.

I was excited to read Deloitte's recent announcement of the expanded AI advisory practice (press release, 2026-02-08). My deployment work on a Flask-served churn model aligns with the kind of ML productionisation your team is scaling.

Thank you for considering my application. I would love the opportunity to discuss how my analytics background could contribute to your team.

Sincerely,

Eduardo Test

SAMPLE_INTERVIEW_PREP_MD = """# Interview Prep: Data Analyst — Deloitte

## SQL
### Window functions over a sales table
Walk the interviewer through using ROW_NUMBER() partitioned by customer_id, ordered by purchase_date DESC, to find the most recent purchase per customer. Mention the alternative of a correlated subquery and why the window function is faster.

## Case Study
### Declining revenue at a retail client
Frame: problem definition → hypothesis tree (price? mix? volume? external?) → data to collect → quick-win recommendation. Reference your capstone on inventory optimization as proof you've done this shape before.

## Behavioral STAR
### Tell me about a time you handled ambiguous data
Situation: capstone consulting project at FirmX with incomplete SKU-level history. Task: estimate weekly demand. Action: triangulated using POS exports + manually tagged supplier catalogs. Result: 12% forecast-error reduction vs. baseline.

# Issue #19 — synthetic blocks from `**Title** | metadata` under `##`
#
# Before the fix, `parse_resume_markdown` only recognized `**Title**` as a
# sub-block when it appeared inside a `### Company` block. Tailors often emit
# `**Project**` directly under `## Research Experience` without the `###`
# wrapper, and the parser was silently dropping the titles into
# raw_paragraphs and the bullets into raw_bullets. The renderer emitted
# all titles first, then all bullets — reader could not tell which bullet
# belonged to which project.
#
# After the fix: `**Title** | metadata` at section level creates a synthetic
# ResumeBlock. Bullets attach to it until the next `**Title**` or `##`.
# The trailing-metadata check is load-bearing — bold-only prose like
# "**Accomplished leader.**" in a Summary still falls through to paragraphs.
