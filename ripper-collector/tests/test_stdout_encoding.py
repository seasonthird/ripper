"""
Regression tests for UTF-8 stdout/stderr reconfiguration at CLI entry points.

Windows Python defaults stdout/stderr to the system ANSI code page (typically
CP1252) when not attached to a TTY — which is exactly the shape every CI run
and every `ripper-collector-exec` invocation takes. Prompt templates, rendered
markdown, and user-facing output routinely include `→`, `…`, curly quotes,
and non-ASCII names that CP1252 cannot encode. Without the reconfigure calls
at each `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, those writes raise
UnicodeEncodeError and the pipeline dies mid-phase.

Windows CI (#34) surfaced this class of bug in `test_prompts.py`, but the
problem is production-path — any Windows student running orchestration,
render_pdf, or github_mine hits it the moment output includes a `→`.

These tests simulate the Windows behavior on any OS by invoking the CLIs
with `PYTHONIOENCODING=cp1252`, which makes CPython's TextIOWrapper use the
same CP1252 encoding Windows picks by default. Without the reconfigure
fix, the CLIs raise UnicodeEncodeError; with the fix, they emit the UTF-8
bytes into the stdout pipe regardless of what encoding the environment
asked for.
