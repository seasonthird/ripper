"""Tier 3: live LLM regression test for issue #46.

Invokes `claude -p` against Opus 4.7 with the real tailor prompt and a
synthetic candidate whose folder summary contains TWO thematically-related
GitHub repos. Asserts the tailor LLM emits separate `### {Name} ({URL})`
H3 blocks for each repo, NOT a single combined heading like
`### foo + bar (github.com/me/foo, github.com/me/bar)`.

The bug surfaced in @earino's run on PR #43, where two related repos
(`prompt-harness` and `nonprofit.ai`) ended up under one combined H3.
The renderer's title-collapse logic only handles `Name (single URL)`, so
combined headings rendered as inline-URL fallback — visually
inconsistent with the other project entries and ATS-confusing.

The fix is a prompt-template change in `scripts/prompts.py` (the tailor
template's Projects section now contains an explicit "One project per
H3 heading" rule with concrete `+`/`/`/`&` combiner examples to avoid).
This live test verifies the prompt change actually changes Opus's
behavior on the exact shape of input that produced the bug.

## Auto-skip conditions

  - `claude` CLI not on PATH (CI runners, fresh clones — typical case)
  - `RIPPER_COLLECTOR_SKIP_LIVE=1` (manual escape hatch)

Cost: one Opus tailor pass per test. ~30-60s wall time, ~30K tokens —
zero on Claude Max, a few cents on pay-as-you-go.

## Companion tests

  - `tests/test_prompts.py::test_tailor_prompt_*` — structural assertions
    on the prompt text. Those gate against the rule being silently
    dropped from the template by a future edit. THIS test gates against
    the prompt change actually working at the LLM-behavior level.
